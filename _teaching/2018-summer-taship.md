TAship in Bilkent AI Summer School (Bilkent Yapay Zeka Yaz Okulu - YZYO). 

Bilkent YZYO is a one-week-long program where we teach programming using Python and fundamentals of AI/ML to high school students. This year, the courses are taught by [Dr. Hamdi Dibeklioğlu](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~dibeklioglu/). For details of the event, see: [http://yzyo.bilkent.edu.tr/](http://yzyo.bilkent.edu.tr/)

At the end of the event, we had our photo taken in front of the statue of İhsan Doğramacı, the founder of Bilkent University. See the photo below.
