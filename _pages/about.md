Hello there. I'm Alican, currently pursuing an M.Sc. degree in Computer Science in Bilkent University, Turkey. I'm a member of [Bilkent Information Retrieval Group (BilIR)](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~canf/bilir_web/) and advised by [Prof. Fazli Can](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~canf/). My Master's Thesis is on multi-label learning in nonstationary data streams.


##  Recent News

- **[15 Mar 2019]**   Got accepted to [Danai Koutra](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/)'s [GEMS Lab](https://gemslab.github.io/) for my Ph.D. in CSE at University of Michigan Ann Arbor! :confetti_ball: :tada:


## Research Interests

Apart from multi-label learning and data streams, I'm interested in graph mining, graph theory, representation learning in NLP, adversarial examples and adversarial training in neural networks.

- Currently I'm working on multi-label stream data generation methods with concept drifts. This involves generating different types of concept drifts, modeling dynamic dependencies between labels over time, and quantifying the magnitude of drifts.

- In addition, I'm investigating continuous representations for phrases and sentences in NLP. There has been a significant progress in terms of word representations, but still not much insight on how these representations can be combined together to construct representations for variable-length sequences of words. Capturing semantic information in these representations can improve performance of text classification, sentiment analysis and so on.

- In my first year of master's, I did a survey on [adversarial attacks and adversarial examples](http://github.com/abuyukcakir/adversarial-training-survey). It is a nice introductory article that assumes no prior knowledge on adversarial learning whatsoever.  



### Hobbies

- I read. You can look at my [Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38006745-alican-buyukcakir) for what I'm reading nowadays and what my book taste is like in general. You'll see some classics, magical realism, history of science, scientist biographies, spiritualism and esoterism, scifi/fantasy there.
