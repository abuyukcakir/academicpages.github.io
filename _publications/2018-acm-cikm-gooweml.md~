## An excerpt from ABSTRACT
In this study, we introduce a novel online and dynamically-weighted stacked ensemble for multi-label classification, called GOOWE-ML, that utilizes spatial modeling to assign optimal weights to its component classifiers. Our model can be used with any existing incremental multi-label classification algorithm as its base classifier. We conduct experiments with 4 GOOWE-ML-based multi-label ensembles and 7 baseline models on 7 real-world datasets from diverse areas of interest. Our experiments show that GOOWE-ML ensembles yield consistently better results in terms of predictive performance in almost all of the datasets, with respect to the other prominent ensemble models.
