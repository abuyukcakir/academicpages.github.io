I've been given one of the three Outstanding TA Awards by the Bilkent University in CS Fair 2018. Thanks for all the voters :). It's a huge honor, fellas. Also, kudos to my office mate Ömer Gözüaçık for receiving another one of the outstanding TAships. He is a member of Bilkent Information Retrieval Group as well.
