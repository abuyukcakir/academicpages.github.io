I've been given the Outstanding TA Award by the Bilkent University in CS Fair 2018. Thanks for all the voters :). It's a huge honor, fellas.

Also, congrats to my office mate Ömer Gözüaçık for receiving one of the other two outstanding TAships. He is a member of Bilkent Information Retrieval Group as well.
