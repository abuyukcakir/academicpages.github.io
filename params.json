DepthCube takes your everyday environment and turns it into a virtual playground which you see through device’s camera. We want to create an environment where virtual objects interacts with the real formation of your environment. In this sense, players will interact with the game console using their mobile devices as gamepads.\r\n\r\nIn the core application, DepthCube will provide device/application with the precise location of the device relative to the room with the fine details about formation of the environment around. We want to achieve this goal using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, with minimizing the need of an additional hardware. The problem with the current state of the AR applications is the lack of computational power on the mobile devices, combined with the difficulty of providing real-time environmental formation. We want to tackle this problem with the additional computing power provided by DepthCube and better algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## People\r\n\r\n### Project Team:\r\n * Alican Büyükçakır\r\n * Serkan Demirci\r\n * Semih Günel\r\n * Burak Savlu\r\n\r\n### Supervisor\r\n * Prof. Uğur Güdükbay\r\n\r\n### Innovation expert\r\n * Armağan Yavuz from [TaleWorlds](https://www.taleworlds.com/)\r\n\r\n### Jury members\r\n * Assoc. Prof. Selim Aksoy\r\n * Prof. Özgür Ulusoy                 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \r\n## Reports\r\n\r\n### Project Specification Report:\r\n... insert link here ...\r\n### Analysis Report:\r\n... insert link here ...\r\n### High-Level Design Report:\r\n... insert link here ...\r\n### Low-Level Design Report:\r\n... insert link here ...\r\n### Final Report:\r\n... insert link",
